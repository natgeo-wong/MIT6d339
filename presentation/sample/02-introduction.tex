\subsection{Overview}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Overview}
    This paper investigates the relationship between \textbf{tropical precipitation} and \textbf{total column water vapour} using both a \textbf{Cloud Resolving Model (CRM)} and a simplified \textbf{two-layer model}.

    But first, some definitions.  What exactly is/are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause
        \item Total Column Water Vapour?
        \pause
        \item Cloud Resolving Models (and their differences from normal GCMs)?
